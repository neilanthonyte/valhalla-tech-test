#### Details:

1. I uploaded the tech-test api to heroku under the domain name "https://valhall-tech-test.herokuapp.com/" so the mobile app can access it publicly. I will delete it once the test is done. **NOTE:** Under the free heroku account the API will sleep if idle for 30 minutes so during the first request there might be a little delay.

1. I built an APK so the app can be tested on a real android device. The apk can be downloaded via the link https://drive.google.com/file/d/14gcgrVVabz5KubywFB3NDZKuNZDDwCEM/view?usp=sharing or you can install the APK under the folder APK_TEST located in the project root directory.
